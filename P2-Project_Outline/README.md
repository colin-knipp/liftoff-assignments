### Overview
Like many full time workers stuck at home during the quarantine I decided to begin investing in my future by researching stock options and trading strategies. I unfortunately didn't have much of a strategy and did not do well, but I also passed up the more obvious resources for learning like paper trading. I work for a financial insitituion, but in IT support. Conveniently 3-4 months into my foray the company made our department a covered position, adding a laundry list of compliance protocols and restrictions on things retail traders would normally take advantage of, so I had to close my RobinHood account and take the loss.

Hence the inspiration for this app. I don't know much about paper trading services that are available, but it seems many of the trading platforms have robust API's to support automated trading. I plan to find a more public source of information that I can build a simple trading platform around and track fake investments in real time without giving a service my personal info for a chance at a cash prize that may or may not exist.

### Features
Anonymous app usage, track investments using fake money using real market info without providing your information to some bank that wants to advertise to you

Planned Expansion/Tier 2: 
Input a twitter feed, discord channel, reddit thread, or other suggested social media that can scrape an active page continuously to simulate a large number of trades and potentially create a massive mess of a portfolio quickly.

It's all fake money so I imagine this is all fine with fake money.. lots of the premium options and algo data alert service on twitter and discord (to me) are walking the line of unlicensed financial advice but I know *very little* about it..
